# Portfolio
I developed a comprehensive Retail Management System using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, running on the XAMPP server environment. The system was designed to streamline core retail operations such as product management, inventory tracking, billing, and customer record handling. PHP was used for server-side logic, ensuring smooth data processing and secure communication with the MySQL database. The database was structured to efficiently store and retrieve product, sales, and user information.

On the front-end, I used HTML and CSS to build a clean, responsive interface with consistent styling, while JavaScript was implemented to enhance interactivity, form validation, and dynamic content updates. I also applied UI/UX principles throughout the design process, focusing on intuitive navigation, organized layouts, and user-friendly workflows to improve efficiency for store staff and administrators.

The system was fully tested and deployed on XAMPP for local hosting, providing a seamless execution environment for development and debugging. Overall, this project integrates strong front-end design and robust back-end functionality to deliver a practical, efficient, and easy-to-use retail management solution.
