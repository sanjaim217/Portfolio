I developed this project using HTML and CSS, ensuring a well-structured layout and responsive design across different devices. The front-end was built with clean, semantic HTML to improve accessibility and readability. Using CSS, I implemented modern styling techniques such as Flexbox/Grid, custom color palettes, and interactive UI elements to enhance visual appeal and functionality.

In addition to coding, I applied strong UI/UX design principles throughout the project. This included creating a clear and intuitive user flow, choosing consistent typography and spacing, and organizing content to improve usability. I focused on delivering a smooth user experience by reducing visual clutter, optimizing navigation, and prioritizing key actions. Through wireframing and iterative design improvements, I ensured the interface was both aesthetically pleasing and user-centered.

Overall, the project combines solid front-end development with thoughtful UI/UX design to provide a clean, engaging, and accessible user experience.
